Problem 'instancias/formato_lp/karasans/K-1500-200-0.9-b-100_oplminimos.dat.lp' read.
Read time = 2.63 sec. (113.41 ticks)
Presolve has eliminated 121290 rows and 152 columns...
Presolve has improved bounds 8162 times...
Presolve time = 748.45 sec. (3310681.74 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =  748.56 sec. (3310744.82 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =  748.56 sec. (3310744.82 ticks)
