Read time = 2.61 sec. (115.28 ticks)
Presolve has eliminated 122423 rows and 160 columns...
Presolve has improved bounds 7802 times...
Presolve time = 856.90 sec. (3479673.60 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =  857.01 sec. (3479738.28 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
